Pg3 Preface,

pg4 no quotes 

pg5 quantum physicist

pg7 ordering?
 background normally goes into the intro? 
rename weird vectors section to overview?

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION
introduction with subsections
pg9 add in some q tech using semiconductor industry?


WEIRD VECTOR THINGS
pg13 linear algebra necessary? 
pg14 no subscripts, maybe do logical ops on 1 bit first then go to registers?

GATE MODEL
pg16 pls finish section
pg 17 merge vectors and gate model into one section?

need to include notation for control on 1, control on 0 and registers using -/-

have a separate section on universality? 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
CHAPTER 2 QUANTUM PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

GENERAL 
pg19 can we sort out that list?

ALL of the languages here are python libraries.
so you only need to know python syntax

add footnote explaining problem with using 'compiler' 

should we make a general template for all of the languages so the subsections
are consistent?

Which library is most beginner friendly?

Are we putting in circuit diagrams?

use either listings for all code or \texttt{} 

maybe put comparison at start of the section and mention which languages run on
which hardware in the case someone wants to specifically use the Acorn chip...

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RIGETTI
pg20 say forest is name of everything 
Grove is alogrithms and pre written code. Many examples etc.
Pyquil is python library which translates into Quil code 
then either simulator QVM or QPU.

diagram is not helpful

listing 2.1, can use np.diag(),
use lists to reduce syntax?

pg22 can you explain what each import is doing explicitly?
object oriented should we explain what 
qvm=QVMConnection() and P=Program() is doing?

pg23 what is cr=[] a blank list doing?

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IBM QISKIT
pg23 get rid of 'high level language python'
pg25 maybe also say could do HX|0> to show there are equivalent decompositions?
can you include the python code for the circuit you've got?

examples

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
PROJECT Q
pg28 Domain-specific language embedded in python, more like a library than a full
language
compiler?

examples

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Q#
pg30 Platform
Online documentation is terrible 
different to the other libraries (languages) as uses a driver program?

least cross-plaform friendly 
install and set up guide?
.NET core is available on linux and macos supposedly.

can't assign values to qubits 
pg31 what is a namespace? maybe say it is a library or module?

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
FURTHER LANGUAGES
pg33 
QDK is Q#
mention Languages:

Scaffold
QCL
literally anything other than another python library

pg34 put exercises at the end of the guide?

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SHORT TERM QC




!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IMPLEMENTATION

rigetti compiler
qiskit compiler
project q compiler

would be good if you could set a qubit to value |1> without having to do x|0>




!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

More people on programming?

Non-locality and Bell states?
Super dense coding
