\section{The Schur Transform}

\textit{background.}

2004 Bacon, Chuang \& Harrow proposed a scheme for implementing the Schur transform in Poly time. 

There are two distinct ways of performing the Schur transform on $n$ qubits, it can either be built up from coupling all $n$ qubits together in a single iteration which we call the spatial multiplexed approach. The other approach is performing Clebsch-Gordan (CG) transforms on the $n$ qubits one at a time which we call the temporal multiplexed approach.
