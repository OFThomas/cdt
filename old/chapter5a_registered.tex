\subsection{Registering J \& M explicitly \autoref{cir:spatialmulti2}, \autoref{cir:minspatialmult}}

The registered circuit, which takes in two qubits can be constructed from 11 gates if the m register is not compressed. The spatially multiplexed minimal gate explicit J \& M 2 qubit transform is shown in \autoref{cir:minspatialmult} which contains 11 two-qubit gates. Another CNOT can be added to compress the M' register, which means using the same values for M'=0, see \autoref{cir:spatialmulti2} for the 12 two-qubit gate circuit.

This spatial multiplexing approach only stores the final output values of the $J$ \& $M$ registers.
